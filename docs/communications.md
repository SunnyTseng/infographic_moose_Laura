## Title

> Whose line is it anyway? Moose response  to linear features


## Introduction

> Linear features (seismic lines, pipelines, and roads) are widespread in Canada's boreal forest and negatively affect multiple wildlife species. Effective landscape restoration requires understanding how different wildlife species, such as moose, respond to linear features in landscape and fine scale. 

 
## Methods

> GPS data from seven moose collected between 2008 and 2010 were analyzed to study their response to linear features.


## Results

### Landscape scale
> - Moose preferred areas closer to seismic lines when these areas had lower densities of seismic lines and higher densities of harvest blocks and wildfires, particularly during winter.

> - Moose also showed a preference for areas near pipelines in regions with lower densities of other linear features, harvest blocks, and wildfires.

### Fine scale
> - During winter, moose consistently selected areas closer to seismic lines regardless of vegetation height or surrounding habitat.

> - In summer, moose were indifferent to all linear features, suggesting that seasonal behavior influences their response to linear features.


## Conclusion

> Seismic lines' inherent attractiveness to moose emphasizes the need to consider landscape permeability and forage availability in linear featue restoration.
